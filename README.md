## 🧠 SFAR: Semantic Fusion Attribute Recovery for Text Attribute Missing Graphs via Large Language Model Knowledge Generalization

This project implements **SFAR**, a graph representation learning framework that incorporates LLM-derived features, graph propagation, and self-supervised contrastive learning. It also includes downstream node classification using both MLP and GCN classifiers.
